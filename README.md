# Study Resources:

I used a combination of materials. Professor Messerâ€™s free videos were a lifesaver! His breakdowns made things easier to understand. I also grabbed some practice exams from various sources like and [ITExamstest](https://www.itexamstest.com/comptia/sy0-701-dumps.html) (helped a ton!).

## 1. Set a Schedule:
Iâ€™m not the most organized person, but I committed to studying at least an hour or two each day after work. Consistency over cramming!

## 2. Practice Tests:
These were the game changers for me. I bombed the first few, but with each attempt, I got better. If you can pass a few solid practice exams, youâ€™ll feel a lot more confident going in.

## 3. PBQs (Performance-Based Questions):
Donâ€™t neglect these! I spent a bit more time working through PBQs because theyâ€™re tricky but worth the effort.

## 4. Donâ€™t Rush the Exam:
During the test, I paced myself. Some questions stumped me, but I flagged them and moved on. Came back to them with a clearer head later.

So if I can pass this exam, seriously, anyone can. Just keep grinding, use the right resources, and donâ€™t lose hope!

Good luck to all those preparingâ€”you got this! ðŸ’ª

Ask me anything if you have questions, happy to help!
